      text: 'The purpose of the search function was somewhat irrelevant. I simply needed to code. Code soothes because it can provide control in moments when the world seems to spiral. Reductively, programming consists of little puzzles to be solved. Not just inert jigsaws on living room tables, but puzzles that breathe with an uncanny life force. Puzzles that make things happen, that get things done, that automate tedium or allow for the publishing of words across the world.'

      description: "WebAssembly was created to build applications for browsers, but it's increasingly finding a home in cloud computing centers.",
      text: "FOR PROGRAMMERS, BUILDING a new application is never as simple as writing the code. That's because most software depends on other software, such as database management systems, to work.
